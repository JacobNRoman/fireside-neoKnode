    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...much like tonight. 
      Computers should've been sleeping, 
      but there was a strange studio to git.
      At last it seemed to be working. 
      All was going well!
      The Git pulled and pushed until there was little RAM left.
      There was a master CPU controlling the horde.
